# V1PER
## V1PER SYNTAX (or general syntax)<br>
 The language is as follows
```java 
________V1PER_________             ________JAVA______ 

 type = [INTEGER]                   //no equivalent syntax
 x = input[type]                    int x = //bufferedreader input;
 y = input[type]                    int y = //scanner input;
 sum is "z = x + y"                 //no equivalent syntax except functions
 
 sum                                int z = x+y;
 
 str = "haha"                       String str = "haha";
 bol = true                         boolean bol = true;
                                                                                 
 (the sum is {z}\n)               System.out.println("the sum is "+z);
 if sum>1{                        if(sum>1){
   (greater than {one}\n)             System.out.println("greater then "+one);
	}                                  }
 else {                             else{
   (not greater than {one}\n)          System.out.println("not greater than "+one);
 }                                  }
 ```
 #### the whole syntax is not made but here are the parts that are made<br>

## About the file<br><br>
As of now there is no fancy extension just a normal txt file as the language is useless right now and yes the file should be in the same directory<br><br>
## How to run<br>
open the terminal or ide and compile and run the java code then it will ask for an argument "> " then just type in "run fileName.txt", the file should be in the same directory as compiler, if you want quicker access then modify the SnekTest.txt and type "runD" as it is set to default path <br>type quit or control-c to exit<br><br>
## The code<br>
I have tried an OOP approach in this compiler instead of the traditional approach of using trees(okay I had to use trees for the assignment) and I feel now that it will ease further developement as adding new features would just be a matter of adding enums and class which can or can not be easier than the tree approach it can be buggy<br><br>
### Version 0.5 (B3TA)<br>
What you see up there is the DESIRED syntax I have handled basics such as printing and assignment but the if else is under developement 
<br><br>
### About the name<br>
well the name comes from the fact that i have created a language with smaller and easier syntax than python<br><br>
